            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Headz Up Barbershop was founded with one mission: to bring professional, fresh, and confidence-boosting cuts to the heart of the community. What started as a single chair in a garage has grown into a full-service shop where tradition meets modern style. Every fade, line-up, and shave is delivered with precision, care, and attention to detail.</p>
            <p>We believe a great haircut does more than change your lookâ€”it uplifts your confidence. That's why at Headz Up, you're not just another clientâ€”youâ€™re family.</p>
